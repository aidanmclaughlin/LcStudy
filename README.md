# LcStudy

An educational app to help people learn and experiment with Leela Chess Zero (LcZero).

This repository is a minimal starter with a Python package, a simple CLI, and a place to grow web and notebook-based lessons.

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.9+

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -e .[all]
lcstudy --help
```

## Goals
- Lower the barrier to trying LcZero
- Offer guided lessons and exercises
- Provide a playground to run positions against lc0 and analyze ideas

## Structure
- src/lcstudy: core package
- src/lcstudy/cli.py: entry point CLI
- lessons/: space for notebooks and guided content
- examples/: minimal sample positions, configs

## New: Learn-to-think-like-Leela web app

This repo includes an experimental local web app that helps you learn to emulate Leela's moves while playing against human-like Maia engines.

Features
- Automatically install the latest LcZero binary and download networks (best Leela net and Maia nets 1100â€“1900)
- Spin up two engines locally: Leela (best net) and Maia (selected level)
- You predict Leela's move each turn; your score reflects how close you are to Leela's choice
- Maia moves quickly with shallow search; first 10 plies are sampled with temperature to diversify openings
- Always analyze from Leela's perspective; Leela always plays the best move

Usage
```bash
# Install
lcstudy install lc0         # downloads latest lc0 binary
lcstudy install bestnet     # downloads best LcZero network
lcstudy install maia        # downloads all Maia networks (1100..1900)
# or everything at once
lcstudy install all

# Single-command setup and run
lcstudy up  # installs lc0 + best net + Maia nets (if missing) and launches the web app

# Or run the web app directly (assuming installs are done)
lcstudy web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Notes
- Apple Silicon is supported by preferring the Metal backend for lc0 on macOS.
- Networks are stored in ~/.lcstudy/nets and the lc0 binary in ~/.lcstudy/bin by default.
- You can override the storage location by setting LCSTUDY_HOME to a directory path.
- The web UI is intentionally minimal; it shows an ASCII board and Leela's top lines, inspired by Nibbler.
- If automatic network downloads fail (e.g., due to API/URL changes), place .pb.gz files in ~/.lcstudy/nets (names: lczero-best.pb.gz, maia-1500.pb.gz, etc.).

## Next steps
- Detect and guide installation of lc0 and required backends
- Add a lightweight web UI and interactive lessons
- Add engines integration (UCI) and basic analysis workflows
